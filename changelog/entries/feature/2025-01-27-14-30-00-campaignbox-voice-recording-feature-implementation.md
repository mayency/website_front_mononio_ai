CampaignBox Voice Recording Feature Implementation

## Description
Implemented a comprehensive voice recording feature in the CampaignBox component that allows users to dictate their business requirements, target audience, and goals using speech recognition. The feature includes continuous listening, multiple language support, and real-time transcription display.
