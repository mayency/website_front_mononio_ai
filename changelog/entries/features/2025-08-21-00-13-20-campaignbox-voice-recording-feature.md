## Title
CampaignBox Voice Recording Feature Implementation

## Description
Enhanced the CampaignBox component with voice recording capabilities using microphone integration. The component now includes a toggle recording button that switches between microphone and stop icons, providing visual feedback during recording sessions. This feature allows users to either type or speak their business details, improving accessibility and user experience. The implementation includes proper TypeScript declarations for the Speech Recognition API and uses react-icons for consistent iconography.
