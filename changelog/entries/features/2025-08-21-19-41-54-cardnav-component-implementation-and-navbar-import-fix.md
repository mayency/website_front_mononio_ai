## Title
CardNav Component Implementation and Navbar Import Fix

## Description
Implemented a sophisticated CardNav component with GSAP animations, responsive design, and accessibility features. The component includes smooth height transitions, card-based navigation layout, and proper TypeScript typing. Also fixed the Navbar logo import issue by changing from ES6 import to string constant for Next.js static asset handling.
