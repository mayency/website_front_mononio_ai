## Title
Logo file organization and path updates

## Description
Reorganized the Mononio logo file structure by moving it from the general logos directory to a dedicated brand directory, and updated the page.tsx file to reference the new location. This improves file organization and makes the brand assets more discoverable.

## Before
- Logo was located at `public/logos/Mononio_Logo_1.png`
- Page.tsx referenced the logo using `/logos/Mononio_Logo_1.png`
- Brand assets were mixed with other logo files

## After
- Logo is now located at `public/brand/Mononio_Logo.png`
- Page.tsx references the logo using `/brand/Mononio_Logo.png`
- Brand assets are organized in a dedicated directory
- Logo filename simplified from `Mononio_Logo_1.png` to `Mononio_Logo.png`

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/page.tsx` - Updated mask image paths
  - `public/logos/Mononio_Logo_1.png` - Moved to `public/brand/Mononio_Logo.png`
- **Performance Impact**: No performance impact, same file size and loading
- **Code Quality**: Improved file organization and maintainability

## Benefits
- Better file organization with dedicated brand directory
- Cleaner file naming convention
- Improved discoverability of brand assets
- More scalable structure for future brand-related files
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving organization

## Testing

- [x] File path verification - New paths resolve correctly
- [x] Code review completed

## Metrics
