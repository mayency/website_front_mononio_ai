# CardNav Interaction and Accessibility Improvements

## Title
Enhanced CardNav Component Interaction Behavior and Accessibility

## Description
Improved the CardNav component's user interaction by making the entire navigation area clickable while preventing unwanted menu toggles on logo and link clicks. Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes.

## Before
- Only the hamburger menu button was clickable to toggle the navigation
- Logo and navigation links could accidentally trigger menu toggle
- Limited accessibility features for screen readers

## After
- Entire navigation area is now clickable to toggle the menu
- Logo container prevents event propagation to avoid unwanted menu toggles
- Navigation links prevent event propagation to avoid unwanted menu toggles
- Added aria-hidden attribute for better screen reader support
- Improved user experience with larger clickable area

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: app/components/CardNav.tsx
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - only adds event handlers and stopPropagation calls
- **Code Quality**: Improved event handling and accessibility compliance

## Benefits
- Better user experience with larger clickable area
- Prevents accidental menu toggles when clicking logo or links
- Enhanced accessibility for screen reader users
- More intuitive navigation interaction

## Testing
- [ ] Functionality testing for menu toggle behavior
- [ ] Event propagation testing for logo and link clicks
- [ ] Accessibility testing with screen readers
- [ ] Code review completed

## Metrics
