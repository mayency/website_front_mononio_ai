# Navigation Logo Sizing Improvements and Hamburger Menu Optimization

## Changes Made

### Navigation Logo Sizing
- **Fixed CSS override issue**: Added specific CSS rule in `globals.css` to allow height control for navigation logos
- **Implemented responsive logo sizing**: Updated logo height classes to be responsive across different screen sizes
- **Optimized container dimensions**: Increased navigation container height from 60px to 80px to accommodate logo properly
- **Reduced padding**: Changed logo container padding from `py-3` to `py-1` for better space utilization

### Hamburger Menu Optimization
- **Hidden hamburger menu**: Added `hidden` class to hamburger menu container to remove visual clutter
- **Maintained functionality**: Navigation menu still works when clicking the logo area
- **Improved visual focus**: Logo now has more prominence without competing hamburger menu

### Technical Details
- **File**: `app/components/CardNav.tsx`
  - Updated logo height classes: `h-[22px] sm:h-[28px] lg:h-[31px] xl:h-[39px] 2xl:h-[45px]`
  - Increased container height: `h-[60px]` → `h-[80px]`
  - Reduced padding: `py-3` → `py-1`
  - Hidden hamburger: Added `hidden` class to hamburger container

- **File**: `app/globals.css`
  - Added CSS rule: `.logo-container img { height: unset; }` to override global image height restrictions
