# Feature: ScrollStack 3D Animation Component Implementation

## Title
ScrollStack 3D Animation Component Implementation

## Description
Implemented a sophisticated ScrollStack component that creates stunning 3D stacking animations with scroll-based interactions. The component features advanced scroll-triggered animations, 3D transforms, blur effects, and responsive scaling that adapts to different screen sizes. It provides a modern, engaging user experience with smooth performance optimizations.

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Creates immersive, interactive scroll experiences with 3D card stacking effects
- **Performance**: Optimized with requestAnimationFrame, transform caching, and hardware acceleration
- **Responsiveness**: Adaptive scaling and positioning based on screen size (supports 24" to 32"+ displays)
- **Accessibility**: Maintains smooth scrolling and proper focus management
- **Visual Appeal**: Advanced blur effects, rotation, and scaling create depth and visual hierarchy

## Technical Details
- **Files Created**: `app/components/ScrollStack.tsx`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - React hooks: `useLayoutEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`
  - CSS transforms and 3D properties
- **Key Features**:
  - 3D card stacking with configurable distance and scale
  - Scroll-triggered animations with smooth transitions
  - Blur effects for depth perception
  - Rotation and scaling animations
  - Responsive positioning based on screen width
  - Performance optimizations with transform caching
  - Scroll chaining for seamless user experience
- **Configuration Options**:
  - `itemDistance`: Distance between stacked items
  - `itemScale`: Scale factor for each stacked item
  - `itemStackDistance`: Vertical spacing in stack
  - `stackPosition`: Trigger position for stacking
  - `scaleEndPosition`: End position for scaling
  - `baseScale`: Base scale for items
  - `rotationAmount`: Rotation effect intensity
  - `blurAmount`: Blur effect intensity
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Hardware acceleration with `translateZ(0)`
  - Transform caching to prevent unnecessary updates
  - RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
  - Passive event listeners where possible
  - Will-change properties for optimization hints

## Breaking Changes
None - This is a new component addition.

## Usage Example
```tsx
<ScrollStack
  itemDistance={200}
  itemScale={0.03}
  itemStackDistance={30}
  stackPosition="20%"
  scaleEndPosition="10%"
  baseScale={0.85}
  rotationAmount={2}
  blurAmount={1}
  onStackComplete={() => console.log('Stack animation complete')}
>
  <ScrollStackItem>Content 1</ScrollStackItem>
  <ScrollStackItem>Content 2</ScrollStackItem>
  <ScrollStackItem>Content 3</ScrollStackItem>
</ScrollStack>
```

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS 3D transforms support
- WebKit browsers with hardware acceleration
- Mobile browsers with touch scroll support
