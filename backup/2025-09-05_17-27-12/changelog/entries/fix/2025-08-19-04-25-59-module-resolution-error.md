# Bug Fix Template

## Title
Module Resolution Error Fix

## Description
Resolved module resolution errors for @/components imports by verifying and maintaining proper TypeScript path mapping configuration.

## Issue
The development server was showing errors like "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/Navbar'" despite the components existing in the correct location.

## Solution
Verified that the tsconfig.json path mapping was correctly configured with `"@/*": ["app/*"]` and ensured all component imports use the correct relative paths.

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: app/page.tsx (import statements)
- **Root Cause**: Import path resolution issues
- **Fix Type**: Path mapping verification

## Testing
- [x] All component imports resolve correctly
- [x] Development server starts without module errors
- [x] Components render properly

## Impact
Ensures reliable module resolution and eliminates import-related build errors.
